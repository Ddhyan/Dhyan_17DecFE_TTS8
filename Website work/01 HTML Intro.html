<h2>WEB</h2>
<p>an interconnected system of public webpages accessible through the Internet. The Web is not the same as the Internet: the Web is one of many applications built on top of the Internet</p>
<h2>WWW</h2>
<p>World Wide Web, which is also known as a Web, is a collection of websites or web pages stored in web servers and connected to local computers through the internet. These websites contain text pages, digital images, audios, videos, etc. Users can access the content of these sites from any part of the world over the internet using their devices such as computers, laptops, cell phones, etc. The WWW, along with internet, enables the retrieval and display of text and media to your device.
</p>
<h2>Browser</h2>
<p>A browser is an application program that provides a way to look at and interact with all the information on the World Wide Web. This includes Web pages, videos and images. The word "browser" originated prior to the Web as a generic term for user interfaces that let you browse (navigate through and read) text files online. Many people will use web browsers today for access to the internet and is seen almost as a necessity in how many navigate their daily life.</p>
<h2>Address bar</h2>
<p>The address bar is the familiar text field at the top of a web browser's graphical user interface (GUI) that displays the name or the URL (uniform resource locator) of the current web page. Users request websites and pages by typing either the name or the URL into the address bar.</p>
<h2>titlebar</h2>
<p>The title bar at the top of a window displays an application-defined icon and line of text. The text specifies the name of the application and indicates the purpose of the window. The title bar also makes it possible for the user to move the window using a mouse or other pointing device.</p>
<h2>HTTP/HTTPS</h2>
<p> HTTPS is a security-enhanced version of Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), the application protocol through which all data communication on the web happens. HTTP helps web users retrieve web pages.</p>
<h2>URL / URI</h2>
<p>URL is used to describe the identity of an item. URI provides a technique for defining the identity of an item. URL links a web page, a component of a web page or a program on a web page with the help of accessing methods like protocols. URI is used to distinguish one resource from other regardless of the method used.</p>
<h2>Extension</h2>
<p> a file containing programming that serves to extend the capabilities of or data available to a more basic program. Extensions are sometimes required to be stored in a separate extensions file so that they're easy to locate.</p>
<h2>Editor</h2>
<p>Editors or text editors are software programs that enable the user to create and edit text files. In the field of programming, the term editor usually refers to source code editors that include many special features for writing and editing code</p>
<h2>Network</h2>
<p>A network consists of two or more computers that are linked in order to share resources (such as printers and CDs), exchange files, or allow electronic communications. The computers on a network may be linked through cables, telephone lines, radio waves, satellites, or infrared light beams.</p>
<h2>TCP/IP</h2>
<p>TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol. TCP/IP is a set of standardized rules that allow computers to communicate on a network such as the internet.</p>
<h2>Hosting</h2>
<p>A hosting is a place where files are stored. Normally a company offers its web hosting services by renting its servers to store the web, making it easier for other users to access it. The domain is a website address. The domain name must be registered and is unique, something like your home address.</p>
<h2>Domain</h2>
<p>It's the unique name that appears after the @ sign in email addresses, and after www. in web addresses</p>
<h2>Server</h2>
<p>server, network computer, computer program, or device that processes requests from a client (see client-server architecture). On the World Wide Web, for example, a Web server is a computer that uses the HTTP protocol to send Web pages to a client's computer when the client requests them</p>
<h2>Client</h2>
<p>Used in home and corporate networks, a client is any computer hardware or software device that requests access to a service provided by a server. Clients are typically seen as the requesting program or user in a client-server architecture</p>

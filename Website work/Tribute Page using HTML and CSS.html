                About Warren Buffett
            </h1>
            <p> Buffett was born in Omaha, Nebraska. He developed an interest in business and investing in his youth,
                eventually entering the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1947 before transferring to
                and
                graduating from the University of Nebraska at 19.</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>Buffett was born in 1930 in Omaha, Nebraska, the second of three children and the only son of Leila (n√©e
                Stahl) and Congressman Howard Buffett.[14] He began his education at Rose Hill Elementary School. In
                1942,
                his father was elected to the first of four terms in the United States Congress, and after moving with
                his
                family to Washington, D.C., Warren finished elementary school, attended Alice Deal Junior High School
                and
                graduated from what was then Woodrow Wilson High School in 1947, where his senior yearbook picture
                reads:
                "likes math; a future stockbroker."[15] After finishing high school and finding success with his side
                entrepreneurial and investment ventures, Buffett wanted to skip college to go directly into business but
                was
                overruled by his father</p>
            <br>
            <p>Buffett worked from 1951 to 1954 at Buffett-Falk & Co. as an investment salesman; from 1954 to 1956 at
                Graham-Newman Corp. as a securities analyst; from 1956 to 1969 at Buffett Partnership, Ltd. as a general
                partner; and from 1970 as chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In 1961, Buffett revealed that 35% of the partnership's assets were invested in the Sanborn Map Company.
                He
                explained that Sanborn stock sold for only $45 per share in 1958, but the company's investment portfolio
                was
                worth $65 per share. This meant that Sanborn's map business was being valued at "minus $20." Buffett
                eventually purchased 23% of the company's outstanding shares as an activist investor, obtaining a seat
                for
                himself on the board of directors, and allied with other dissatisfied shareholders to control 44% of the
                shares. To avoid a proxy fight, the board offered to repurchase shares at fair value, paying with a
                portion
                of its investment portfolio. 77% of the outstanding shares were turned in.[40][41] Buffett had reaped a
                50%
                return on investment in just two years.</p>
            <br>
            <p>On August 14, 2014, the price of Berkshire Hathaway's shares hit $200,000 a share for the first time,
                capitalizing the company at $328 billion. While Buffett had given away much of his stock to charities by
                this time, he still held 321,000 shares worth $64.2 billion. On August 20, 2014, Berkshire Hathaway was
                fined $896,000 for failing to report December 9, 2013, purchase of shares in USG Corporation as
                required.[74]

                In 2009, Buffett invested $2.6 billion as a part of Swiss Re's campaign to raise equity capital.[75][76]
                Berkshire Hathaway already owned a 3% stake, with rights to own more than 20%.[77] Also in 2009, Buffett
                acquired Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp. for $34 billion in cash and stock. Alice Schroeder, author
                of
                Snowball, said that a key reason for the purchase was to diversify Berkshire Hathaway from the financial
                industry.[78] Measured by market capitalization in the Financial Times Global 500, Berkshire Hathaway
                was
                the eighteenth largest corporation in the world as of June 2009.[79]

                In 2009, Buffett divested his failed investment in ConocoPhillips, saying to his Berkshire investors,

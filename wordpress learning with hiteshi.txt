ha have access thyu
aa 2 services thi wordpress work kare che
1. apache server 
2. mysql service( database)

wordpress install karta time tamne database nu name puchyu hase

ama me dd wordpress banavyu 6 

right! etle empty database "dd wordpress" ma badhu configuration kari lidhu n aatla tables banya

me just configuration karyu 6 table nata banaya 
ama login karu pa6i j wordpress open thatu hatu 

first time install karo wordpress etle e jate confihgure kari aape tamne badhu j including creating database setup, 
user creation, login

 ok got it 
now let's see enu file structure
tame install karyu pchi eni aakhi directory(folder) bani hase. ema aakhu structurevse banyu hase 

aa open karva xampp server no use karyo. So enu folder xampp ma hase. inside htdocs folder ma
aa folders n files che e default setup ma aavya che
1. wp-admin => All files of wp-admin. Admin dashboard open thay e badhu ahi thi aave. We never modify anything from this folder.
2. wp-content -> aapdi website ma je plugins, themes use karie e badhu ahi thi aave. we always interact with this one if koi customisation karvu hoy in theme/plugin.
 Or we're creating our own theme
3. wp-includes -> we never touch this!
from rest files we'll use only one file wp-config.php -> this stores core configurations such as db(Data base) settings. aadat padi jase db ni don't worry

you'll have to read a breif doc how wordpress structure works. but you'll like it without reading and just playing with it

Also,  Remember ::: aNY APPLICATION/WEBSITE'S ENTRY POINT IS INDEX FILE. LIKE INDEX.PHP/INDEX.JS :::
possible che ema kai pn na hoy, but e tamne application ma entry karavi dese


let's see the configuration file first.
koi pn line "default setup ni file ma" samajvi hoy to mostly eni comment ma samjai jase. na samjay to goole it.
baki nu hamna ignore karo

xampp is domain or database ?
xampp is a softwere which creates a local server in your system so that you can run your application with or without databse
similar softweres : wampp(windows), mamp(MAC), laragon, etc.
